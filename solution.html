        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the nature of the Latino community, and our lack of experience within that community, it was hard for us to get started
            and understand the needs and wants of this group. With a high emphasis on user research, we were able to identify many points of
            pain and implement that within the design of the website, as well as the dynamic of the scheduling system. 
            <br>
            <br>
            From the research we gathered, we wanted to start off by prioritizing an overall simplier web design, as well as an emphasis on a 
            mobile friendly design component. The goal was to create a design that would allow a wider scope of users to be able to use and 
            navigate throghout the website as a result of a more user catered design and experience. With the addition of a mobile friendly 
            design, we were also able to increase the scope because we realized that a portion of this group were not familiar with technology 
            and wanted to provide as many options to access the website itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            On top of the research we did within the community, the user research we conducted on the community based organizers (CBOs) was 
            tremendously influencial in shaping the user flow of the appointment scheduling system, as well as the overall design of the application. 
            By getting user feedback from direct interaction and testing, we were able to visualize many elements of our design that worked well, and 
            portions that were lacking. The user testing was also helpful in providing a second glance, allowing us to identify many bugs, such as 
            translation issues throughout the application.
            <br>
            <br>
            Focusing on the user friendliness of the website became the biggest priority for our team. Working towards this,
            we wanted to display any feature or resource in the most beneficial way possible for any user to use. This helps with
            allowing CBO's manage their patients more easily for scheduled vaccinations. Ultimately, our goal is to put as many shots in
            arms as possible.
