        <h2>TARGET USERS</h2>
        <p>
            The design of the Adios Covid website was made so anyone could get reliable resources
            on Covid-19 with ease. However, there were specific groups of people that would likely use this application
            the most, which are community based organizers and Partners. Both of our stakeholders are individuals or
            groups who would create vaccination dates. So, these same individuals are also our main target user audience.

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            Something that we learned quickly when working with our sponsor is that we didn't have the luxury of going
            along the normal Capstone timeline. As the pandemic is something happening in real time, this urgency made
            us work on a stricter timeline. With this is mind, a lot of updates and design changes were made accordingly.
            <br>
            <br>
            We first conducted different forms of research that was necessary to see what kind of features and design
            implementations could be incorporated on the application. Literature, market, and user interviews were
            conducted along with user research. Our market and literature reseach gave us a better understanding of the problem
            context and how others dealt with similar problems. With our user research, we were able to conduct formal interviews
            to get more feedback and tips to make our web design better. We focused a lot of our efforts here because of how beneficial
            they proved to be. Our initial interviews helped us find big problems that we may have overlooked, and after fixing these changes,
            we conducted two more user interviews to refine the application.
            <br>
            <br>
            Different design choices were made as a result of our feedback and information. We also learned that a
            simple website isn't always an easy to use website. When we had different CBO's of various ages and abilities
            to use technology go through the scheduling process, overall, we found that oversimplifying some sections of
            the website wasn't beneficial. Our team spent extensive time working closely with our sponsor 
            in designing the website to make it user friendly for our users.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using our research as a backbone, we worked with the Adios Covid team's software developer in pushing
            changes and developments. We mainly focused on the creation of the scheduling feature within the website.
            Prototype development along with user research for the appointment system allowed for a refined system
            on the webpage.

        <h2>SPRINTS</h2>
        <div class="sprints">
            <div class="iter">
                <div>
                    <img src='img/1st.png' alt='prototype iteration' class="app">
                    <p>1st Iteration</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src='img/2nd.png' alt='first iteration' class="app">
                    <p>2nd Iteration</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p>
                We focused the first two iterations of the application on displaying the provided resources as simple as possible. Simplicity
                was the core concept that we wanted to focus on. From the prototype to the second iteration, we improved the colors and 
                made larger icons to make it visually nicer to look at. However, we knew there was still improvements to be made.
            </p>

            <br>
            <div class="iter">
                <div>
                    <img src='img/3rd.1.png' alt='second iteration' class="app">
                    <p>3rd Iteration</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src='img/3rd.2.png' alt='second iteration' class="app">
                    <p>3rd Iteration</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our final iteration tackles a lot of the issues that were seen in our past designs. First, we chose to use more vibrant colors
                on the home page to appeal to the demographic more instead of the monotone purple. We also used icons that allowed people to recognize
                more easily what each button would lead to. General improvements to improve the design were made especially on the mobile client as
                this was something we wanted to focus more on. Finally, we made the translation switch easier to press instead of the old design with a
                drop down menu.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also designed two different versions for our sponsor to decide which they would prefer.
