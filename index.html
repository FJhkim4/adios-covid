		<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of COVID-19 infection rates, the Hispanic community within WA has been experiencing a
            disproportionately higher rate of infection compared to the percentage of their population. Many reasons result to this
            like the immigration status of Hispanics, the language barrier, and even the ability to use technology. We decided
            to engage this issue and provide the appropriate aid for this community.
