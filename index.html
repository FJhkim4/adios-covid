		<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of COVID-19 infection rates, the Hispanic community within WA has been experiencing a
            disproportionately higher rate of infection compared to the percentage of their population.
            Through our research we're able to identify a clear disparity in health resources for this community. Our goal was to
            provide support for the Adios Covid team in providing vaccinations for this community.
            We acheived this through different forms of extensive research, design, and coding.

        <h2>TARGET USERS</h2>
        <p>
            The design of the Adios Covid website was made so anyone could get reliable resources
            on Covid-19 with ease. However, there were specific groups of people that would likely use this application
            the most, which are community based organizers and Partners. Both of our stakeholders are individuals or
            groups who would create vaccination dates. So, these same individuals are also our main target user audience.

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            Something that we learned quickly when working with our sponsor is that we didn't have the luxury of going
            along the normal Capstone timeline. As the pandemic is something happening in real time, this urgency made
            us work on a stricter timeline.
            <br>
            <br>
            We first conducted different forms of research that was necessary to see what kind of features and design
            implementations could be incorporated on the application. Literature, market, and user interviews were
            conducted along with user research. We focused our user research around CBO's as they were our main
            target stakeholder.
            <br>
            <br>
            Different design choices were made as a result of our feedback and information. We also learned that a
            simple website isn't always an easy to use website. When we had different CBO's of various ages and abilities
            to use technology go through the scheduling process, overall, we found that oversimplifying some sections of
            the website wasn't beneficial. Our team spent extensive time working closely with our sponsor 
            in designing the website to make it user friendly for our users.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using our research as a backbone, we worked with the Adios Covid team's software developer in pushing
            changes and developments. We mainly focused on the creation of the scheduling feature within the website.
            Prototype development along with user research for the appointment system allowed for a refined system
            on the webpage.

        <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
            Because of the nature of the Latino community, and our lack of experience within that community, it was hard for us to get started
            and understand the needs and wants of this group. With a high emphasis on user research, we were able to identify many points of
            pain and implement that within the design of the website, as well as the dynamic of the scheduling system. 
            <br>
            <br>
            From the research we gathered, we wanted to start off by prioritizing an overall simplier web design, as well as an emphasis on a 
            mobile friendly design component. The goal was to create a design that would allow a wider scope of users to be able to use and 
            navigate throghout the website as a result of a more user catered design and experience. With the addition of a mobile friendly 
            design, we were also able to increase the scope because we realized that a portion of this group were not familiar with technology 
            and wanted to provide as many options to access the website itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            On top of the research we did within the community, the user research we conducted on the community based organizers (CBOs) was 
            tremendously influencial in shaping the user flow of the appointment scheduling system, as well as the overall design of the application. 
            By getting user feedback from direct interaction and testing, we were able to visualize many elements of our design that worked well, and 
            portions that were lacking. The user testing was also helpful in providing a second glance, allowing us to identify many bugs, such as 
            translation issues throughout the application.
            <br>
            <br>
            Focusing on the user friendliness of the website became the biggest priority for our team. Working towards this,
            we wanted to display any feature or resource in the most beneficial way possible for any user to use. This helps with
            allowing CBO's manage their patients more easily for scheduled vaccinations. Ultimately, our goal is to put as many shots in
            arms as possible.
