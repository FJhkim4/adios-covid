            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>
                With the rise of COVID-19 infection rates, the Hispanic community within WA has been experiencing a
                disproportionately higher rate of infection compared to the percentage of their population. Many reasons
                result to this
                like the immigration status of Hispanics, the language barrier, and even the ability to use technology.
                We decided
                to engage this issue and provide the appropriate aid for this community.

            <h2>GOALS</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal throughout this project was to provide support for the Adios Covid team in providing
                vaccinations for this community. We conducted different forms of extensive research, design, 
                and coding to best support this team. We also conducted research on the different users that 
                would find this application useful, such as the community based organizers.

            <h2>OUR SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>
                Learning more about the issues and problems, our team worked toward improving the application’s
                interface without causing concern over private information. We also wanted to incorporate the 
                research findings within the redesign of the web application, such as this communities struggles
                with language barriers as well as technological barriers.
