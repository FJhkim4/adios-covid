		<h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise of COVID-19 infection rates, the Hispanic community within WA has been experiencing a
            disproportionately higher rate of infection compared to the percentage of their population.
            Through our research we're able to identify a clear disparity in health resources for this community. Our goal was to
            provide support for the Adios Covid team in providing vaccinations for this community.
            We acheived this through different forms of extensive research, design, and coding.

        <h2>Target Stakeholders/Users</h2>
        <p>
            The design of the Adios Covid website was made so anyone could get reliable resources
            on Covid-19 with ease. However, there were specific groups of people that would likely use this application
            the most, which are community based organizers and Partners. Both of our stakeholders are individuals or
            groups who would create vaccination dates. So, these same individuals are also our main target user audience.

        <h2>Summary of what we did</h2>
        <p>
            Something that we learned quickly when working with our sponsor is that we didn't have the luxury of going
            along the normal Capstone timeline. As the pandemic is something happening in real time, this urgency made
            us work on a stricter timeline.
            <br>
            <br>
            We first conducted different forms of research that was necessary to see what kind of features and design
            implementations could be incorporated on the application. Literature, market, and user interviews were
            conducted along with user research. We focused our user research around CBO's as they were our main
            target stakeholder.
            <br>
            <br>
            Differnt design choices were made as a result of our feedback and information. We also learned that a
            simple website isn't always an easy to use website. When we had different CBO's of various ages and abilities
            to use technology go through the scheduling process, overall, we found that oversimplifying some sections of
            the website wasn't beneficial. Our team spent extensive time working closely with our sponsor 
            in designing the website to make it user friendly for our users.
            <br>
            <br>
            Using our research as a backbone, we worked with the Adios Covid team's software developer in pushing
            changes and developments. We mainly focused on the creation of the scheduling feature within the website.
            Prototype development along with user research for the appointment system allowed for a refined system
            on the webpage.

        <h2>What benefits our solution provides</h2>
        <p>
            Focusing on the user friendliness of the website became the biggest priority for our team. Working towards this,
            we wanted to display any feature or resource in the most beneficial way possible for any user to use. This helps with
            allowing CBO's manage their patients more easily for scheduled vaccinations. Ultimately, our goal is to put as many shots in
            arms as possible.
